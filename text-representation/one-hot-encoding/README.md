# One-Hot Encoding ðŸ§©

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction
One-Hot Encoding is a technique used to convert **categorical data** (such as words or labels) into a **numerical format** that machine learning models can understand.  
Each unique category is represented as a **binary vector** where only one element is `1` and the rest are `0`.

Example:
- Categories: `["cat", "dog", "fish"]`
- Encoded:
  - `cat â†’ [1, 0, 0]`
  - `dog â†’ [0, 1, 0]`
  - `fish â†’ [0, 0, 1]`
